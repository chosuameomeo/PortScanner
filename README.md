Build a simple command-line tool to scan a target host for open TCP ports using multithreading for speed optimization.

Key Features:

  Accepts an IP address or domain name as input.
  Scans ports from 1 to 1024.
  Uses Python's socket and threading libraries.
  Displays open ports with banners if possible (basic banner grabbing).

Tools/Technologies:

  Python
  Socket module
  Threading module

To run code, open terminal and use command: 'python scanner.py', type in the IP address/ hostname and ports to be scanned, the result will be saved in a .txt file.
